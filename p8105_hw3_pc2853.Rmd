#Problem 1
```{r}
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets")
library(p8105.datasets)
data(brfss_smart2010)
```
```{r}
brfss_smart2010 =
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  filter(response == c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()  %>% 
  mutate(response = forcats::fct_relevel(response, c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))

#### In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?


```{r}
brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(n_locations = n_distinct(locationdesc))
```

Looking at the summarized result about the number of location in each states, the states that have 7 locations are CT, MT, NH, OR, UT.

####Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.
